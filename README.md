# pano.py

A workflow automation wrapper for [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).

You've got `exciting.md` and want a pdf with LuaLaTeX, bibliography support?

```sh
panopy pdf exciting.md
```

Want a self-contained html with Bootstrap too?

```sh
panopy html exciting.md
```

## Installation

```sh
pip install panopy
```

## Purpose

Pandoc requires a large number of command-line arguments to generate any output
format. Typical solutions have been to use makefiles or YAML configurations to
specify what pandoc should do, along with pre/post-processors to clean up
pandoc's shortcomings. This can get messy.

`panopy`'s philosophy is to separate contents from workflow. Content should try
as hard as it can to be agnostic to its output format. Likewise, the file system
should segregate content from the tools needed to process it. Instead of
makefile and document-embedded output specifications, `panopy` uses global YAML
templates to specify workflows around any given input file, combined with
a global script to process it all. So you can write a single markdown file and
push it to whatever formats you need.

At the present moment, panopy is a barebones wrapper allowing for a series of
preprocessing commands, a pandoc command and a series of postprocessing
commands. I can't vouch for its ability to process multiple input files into
a single output. I also doubt that pandoc is fast enough to be an online
processor for multiple files.

## Usage

Panopy looks for a default YAML template file in ~/.pandoc/panopy.templates.
Currently there is no way to change this location. A sample file might looks
something like:

```yaml
__default__:
    s:
    S:
    r: markdown+yaml_metadata_block

latex:
    o: %.tex
    bibliography: ~/Documents/library.bib
    filter:
        - pandoc-citeproc

pdf:
    __inherits__: latex
    o: %.pdf
    latex-engine: pdflatex

fancypdf:
    __inherits__: pdf
    __pre__:
        - gpp -o %.gpp.md %.md
    __in__: %.gpp.md
```

The `__default__` template sets options `-s` (standalone), `-S` (smart), and `-r
markdown+yaml_metadata_block` for all files. The `latex` template changes the
default output format to tex and adds pandoc's bibliography processing filter.
The `pdf` template inherits all settings from `latex` but changes the output to
pdf and sets the latex engine. The `fancypdf` template updates `pdf` to
preprocess the input file with
[gpp](http://files.nothingisreal.com/software/gpp/gpp.html) and changes the
input file to pass to pandoc.

Now just find your input file in the terminal and type:

```sh
panopy fancypdf input.md
```

And if you use vim:

```vim
:!panopy fancypdf %
```
```

### Panopy Keywords

Special templates:

 - `__default__`: provides the default template that all others inherit from

Keywords in template:

 - `%`: auto-replaced by base file name: `panopy pdf infile.md` with template
    option `-o: %.pdf` becomes `-o infile.pdf`. Escape with `\%`
 - `__inherits__`: inherit from named template(s)
 - `__in__`: specifies input file format
 - `__pre__`: specifies commands to run before pandoc
 - `__post__`: specifies commands to run after pandoc
 - `__clear__`: specifies which inherited options to clear

## Similar

 -  [panzer](https://github.com/msprev/panzer) allows you to specify styles at
     the file level (YAML metadata), while `panopy` specifies a workflow at the
     command line. I made `panopy` because I wanted to keep my YAML clean and
     sort of tool agnostic.
